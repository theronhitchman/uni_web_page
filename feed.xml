I am always hopeful at the start of Spring term. One gets
the opportunity to let go of a semester’s worth of disappointments and begin
again. (I am a perfectionist at heart, and never really meet all of my goals.
By midterm it starts to weigh on me.) I am no less happy to meet this new term,
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term I have traded in credit for two completed MA theses supervised for a
course release, and so I have only two preps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 3600/5600 Euclidean Geometry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 3630/5630 Differential Geometry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both courses will have graduates enrolled, so those shadow numbers are
real this time. I am busy working on getting those prepared—I am really
excited about the differential geometry course, as I haven’t taught it in four
years. Students can find course pages for those by clicking on the teaching
link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also continue to mentor my undergraduate research student and my MA
graduate student. Those mentoring projects are what will allow me to
continue doing research in knot theory (a branch of topology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of service commitments to work on this term, as many initiatives
across the University and in my Department have
‘get this done immediately’-style deadlines and will require my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other projects this term are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuing to mentor the participants from the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org&quot;&gt;AIBL&lt;/a&gt; workshop
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/workshopleaders/&quot;&gt;this past summer in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preparing for the next such workshop I will help with, to be held in Minnesota this coming summer,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuing up duties as the new Senior Editor of
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jiblm.org&quot;&gt;
  Journal of Inquiry Based Learning in Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; for modules,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chairing an ad-hoc UNI Mathematics Curriculum Revision Committee,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping rebuild the evaluation criteria and procedures for all of the faculty in my department, (Thanks, Iowa Government!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First-year and transfer advising for math,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and work on various other committees (Undergraduate Research, Recruitment and Retention, Student Outcomes Assessment, Competitions, etc)&lt;/li&gt;

You know what that means: Fall Semester is about here! Okay, sure, the term starts in summer and ends just as winter officially begins, so I suppose the name is apt. But don’t get me started on “Spring Semester.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve started refreshing the site here. In a way that I failed to do last December. Fortunately, that means some things are easy to update, as I am teaching the same courses this fall as I did last:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 2500 Linear Algebra for Applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 3425/5425 Differential Equations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 3600 Euclidean Geometry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can find course pages for those by clicking on the teaching link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geometry and Differential Equations are going to run much the same way as last time. But I am still thinking hard about Linear Algebra, and this will be where I pour most of my “original thinking time” into teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also have at least one undergraduate research student and one MA graduate
student to advise. Those mentoring projects are what will allow me to continue
doing research in knot theory (a branch of topology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might also do a little writing about pedagogy this term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other projects this term are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuing to mentor the participants from the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org&quot;&gt;AIBL&lt;/a&gt; workshop

itself. It has been a while since I have updated this web page, so I thought
it might be time for a total refresh. Everything is new, right down to the
bones, and built with &lt;code&gt;jekyll&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;minimal mistakes&lt;/code&gt; theme. I really like this new look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am especially proud of how the photo in the header came out. I took that one
myself at Brecon Beacons park in Wales, UK, in the summer of 2014. That
summer, I was part of a trio of Americans invited to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cardiff.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Cardiff University&lt;/a&gt; in Wales
to help put on a teaching workshop. (My friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://roberttalbert.org&quot;&gt;Robert Talbert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcernst.github.io&quot;&gt;Dana Ernst&lt;/a&gt; were the others.) I will be
forever grateful to the organizers,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.profpaulharper.com&quot;&gt;Paul Harper&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://vknight.org&quot;&gt;Vincent Knight&lt;/a&gt; for the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term I am teaching the following courses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 2500 Linear Algebra for Applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 3425/5425 Differential Equations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Math 3600 Euclidean Geometry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can find course pages for those by clicking on the teaching link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am deep into rewriting my entire Linear Algebra course from the bottom up.
This will be where I pour most of my “original thinking time” into teaching. I
am excited for this. It will be a lot of work, but worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also have at least one undergraduate research student and one MA graduate
student to advise. Those mentoring projects are what will allow me to continue
doing research in knot theory (a branch of topology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other projects this term are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sigmaa.maa.org/ibl/&quot;&gt;IBL SIGMAA&lt;/a&gt; as Past-Chair,&lt;/li&gt;
